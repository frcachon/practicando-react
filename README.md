## Practicando React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### For first execution:
#### Firstly `npm install`
#### Secondly `npm start`

### For later times
#### Just`npm start`
It runs both the app (in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) and
a fake REST API (in [http://localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004)).
